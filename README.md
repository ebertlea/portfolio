# My GitHub Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my work in Machine Learning, coding challenges, and data science projects.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects

### 1. Contrastive Learning on MNIST
**Repo:** [contrastive-representation-learning](https://github.com/ebertlea/contrastive-representation-learning)
- Implementation of contrastive learning on the MNIST dataset.
- Inspired by my MSc thesis work on contrastive learning for COVID antibody test images.
- Uses PyTorch for model training and evaluation.

### 2. Coding Challenges
